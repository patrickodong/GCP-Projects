# GCP-Practice-Projects
During Learning Phase 2 participants in the Cloud track of the GADS 2020 program shall be encouraged to explore the possibilities and opportunities to work with the gcloud SDK more in detail.  Due to limitations in regards to accessing free Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the Google Cloud challenge is based on the available hands-on labs on Qwiklabs provided by Pluralsight. Learners in the Cloud track have free access to a selection of fundamental labs on GCP.  

The playground  

All Google Cloud learners have access to multiple learning channels on Pluralsight. Each channel provides access to several video courses, and you have access to various labs through Qwiklabs.   The total of hands-on labs is 168 labs (as of writing). All links are provided below as an annex.  

The challenge(s)  

The Cloud challenge is divided in two parts:  
Complete of 10-15 selected hands-on labs on Qwiklabs and submitting proof of such per screenshot based on the email received. 
“Translation” of 2-3 selected labs from Console instructions to 100% command line instructions.
